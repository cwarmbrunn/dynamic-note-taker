// POST REQUEST #1 - RECEIVE NOTE DATA
// Then return the new note to the client
// Need to find a way to give each note a unique ID when it's saved
app.post("/api/notes", (req, res) => {});

// SERVER SET UP (2/2) - THIS MUST GO BELOW EXISTING ROUTES
// FINAL STEP  - Tell app to listen for requests

  console.log(`API server now on port ${PORT} ðŸš€`);
